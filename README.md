The knowledge base I worked on was for the internal team so it is not publically available for your viewing.

I have attached some screenshots and PDF's from the content I worked on, 95% of the articles shown in the homepage screenshots I created.

The PDF's may have some formatting issues due to differences between the PDF downloads and Confluence formatting.

Thank you for your consideration.
